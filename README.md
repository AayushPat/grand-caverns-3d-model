🦇 Grand Caverns Bat Simulation

A Haynes Scholars Research Project | James Madison University

Overview

Proccess_data.py was used to convert the grandcaverns.las file into a .txt file that could be read by netlogo3d as well as subsample the data because using everysingle point in the grand caverns point cloud was way too laggy for my laptop to run.

This project simulates bat behavior and the spread of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in Grand Caverns, a real cave located in Grottoes, Virginia. The simulation was built as part of the Haynes Scholars program at JMU during our freshman year and aims to model how bat populations interact with their environment and how disease spreads through their movement patterns.


Purpose

White-nose syndrome is a devastating fungal disease affecting bat colonies across North America. By simulating its spread within a mapped 3D environment of Grand Caverns, we hoped to better understand the environmental and behavioral factors that influence infection rates and colony stability.

Key Features

📍 Real-World Cave Mapping: The simulation uses a 3D model of Grand Caverns to provide a realistic spatial context for bat movement.
🦇 Bat Behavior Modeling: Bats follow behavioral rules including roosting, foraging, and group movement based on proximity and cave zones.
🧫 Disease Transmission: White-nose syndrome is introduced to simulate how infection propagates through bat interactions over time.
📊 Data Tracking: The simulation collects data on infection rates, survival, and spread patterns, which can be exported for analysis.

Tools & Technologies

NetLogo 3D – Agent-based modeling framework used to build and visualize the simulation
GIS Data / Cave Mapping Resources – Used for accurately modeling Grand Caverns' interior

How to Run (Can't :/ )
The lidar data necessary to run the simulation is was given to me by Professor Angel Garcia and I am very appreciative of this. However When he gave this data he asked that we do not share it as he hasn't made it public yet. It is also around 80gbs so I doubt I could upload it here if I wanted to. This limited the needed files I was able to upload to this repository
